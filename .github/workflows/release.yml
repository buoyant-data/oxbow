# CI that:
#
# * checks for a Git Tag that looks like a release
# * creates a Github Release™ and fills in its text
# * builds artifacts with cargo-dist (executable-zips, installers)
# * uploads those artifacts to the Github Release™
#
# Note that the Github Release™ will be created before the artifacts,
# so there will be a few minutes where the release has no artifacts
# and then they will slowly trickle in, possibly failing. To make
# this more pleasant we mark the release as a "draft" until all
# artifacts have been successfully uploaded. This allows you to
# choose what to do with partial successes and avoids spamming
# anyone with notifications before the release is actually ready.

# This task will run whenever you push a git tag that looks like a version
# like "v1", "v1.2.0", "v0.1.0-prerelease01", "my-app-v1.0.0", etc.
# The version will be roughly parsed as ({PACKAGE_NAME}-)?v{VERSION}, where
# PACKAGE_NAME must be the name of a Cargo package in your workspace, and VERSION
# must be a Cargo-style SemVer Version.
#
# If PACKAGE_NAME is specified, then we will create a Github Release™ for that
# package (erroring out if it doesn't have the given version or isn't cargo-dist-able).
#
# If PACKAGE_NAME isn't specified, then we will create a Github Release™ for all
# (cargo-dist-able) packages in the workspace with that version (this is mode is
# intended for workspaces with only one dist-able package, or with all dist-able
# packages versioned/released in lockstep).
#
# If you push multiple tags at once, separate instances of this workflow will
# spin up, creating an independent Github Release™ for each one.
#
# If there's a prerelease-style suffix to the version then the Github Release™
# will be marked as a prerelease.
