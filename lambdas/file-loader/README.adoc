= File Loader

The `file-loader` is an S3 Event Notifications triggered Lambda whose responsibility is to read structured data files (other than `.parquet`) and convert their contents into link:https://parquet.apache.org[Apache Parquet] data files, appending to a configured Delta Lake location.

toc::[]


for simplicity's sake this Lambda is intended to only work with a single Delta
table. For loading into multiple Delta tables, deploy different instances of
this Lambda triggered by different event sources.
