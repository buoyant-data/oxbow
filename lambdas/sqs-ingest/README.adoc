= SQS Ingest

The `sqs-ingest` is the AWS SQS equivalent of
link:https://github.com/delta-io/kafka-delta-ingest[kafka-delta-ingest] insofar
that it allows the ingestion of JSON data from SQS and translatest each record
into a row appended onto a link:https://delta.io[Delta Lake] table.

toc::[]


for simplicity's sake this Lambda is intended to only work with a single Delta
table. For ingestion to multiple Delta tables, deploy different instances of
this Lambda triggered by different SQS queues.
